# ts-transform

Uses [simple-ts-transform](https://github.com/slune-org/simple-ts-transform) and [ttypescript](https://github.com/cevek/ttypescript) to change typescript code.

Not ideal as it changes whitespace (maybe more things?)

## setup

```
npm install
```

## usage

```
npm run build
```

changes src folder into dist folder applying transformations defined in transformers/index.ts
